# It Hungers

A game made in June 2018 for the third Alakajam game jam.

A game based around an enemy that spreads and slowly covers the environment.

It has some performance issues due to the large environment and uses a relatively inefficient algorithm for deciding what to spread to.
Overall, the game lacks a lot of polish and it shows. Designing the enemy was fun but it took too many iterations to get something that was versatile and light enough in performance to have a game built around it.

Playable versions of the game can be found here:
